# EtherMIDI
Ethernet to MIDI bridge using libfluidsynth

The EtherMIDI project is in an ALPHA state.  It is functional as-is, but
I have only tested it on FreeBSD with an older version of libfluidsynth.
(but the results were SO awesome I had to go ahead and post it now)


This program uses libfluidsynth to generate MIDI output based on UDP packets
received on a listening interface (default 0.0.0.0 on port 5000).

The MIDI packets are in a format as generated by the 'EthernetMIDI' application,
written by Benno Senoner - http://linuxsampler.org/ethernetmidi/

The intent is to allow a Linux or BSD computer to act as a soundfont synth
without additional MIDI cables, from a windows computer using an application
like 'Cakewalk' that requires Windows.

To make this work, you have to be able to run the 'EthernetMIDI' application
on the windows computer, using a 'midi loopback' device (similar to LoopBE;
for more information on LoopBE see http://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe30.html )

Other windows midi loopback driver software also exists.

Then, the MIDI application (let's say cakewalk) will be configured to use
the MIDI loopback device, which will then cause 'EthernetMIDI' to send UDP
packets to a Linux or FreeBSD machine running this program.  Then, the
'EtherMIDI' application (this one) invokes fluidsynth to play the MIDI content.
